                 <p>Snapbid is a bespoke on line booking system for hotels, apartments, holiday homes, bed and breakfasts that allows the customer to negotiate with the accommodation provider directly on a bidding platform. You make a bid for what you want to pay for your stay and see if the price is acceptable. You could be very pleasantly surprised. Accommodation providers can offer very attractive deals to fill up their empty bedrooms.</p>
                 <p>You have the chance to offer a price directly, putting you in control of your booking. The accommodation provider will not post lower prices for the world to see but will sell to you privately at a low price. They have empty bedrooms they need to fill. Even the best and most popular hotels have empty beds at some time.</p>
                 <p>Off peak and out of season deals can be found at incredible prices but take a chance and try to find a room in the busiest periods, you could find that special price that no one else will give you.</p>
                 <p>Snapbid is a secure and safe booking site that is easy to use and fun</p>
