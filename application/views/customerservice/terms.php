<p>PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT HOTEL DETAILS&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the hotel itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the hotel itself, the hotel will charge you in the local currency of the relevant hotel at the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or Snapbid Limited will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). Snapbid Limited reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).</p>
<p>Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By accessing, browsing and using our website or any of our applications through whatever platform, any mobile device, by email or by telephone or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By booking or making a reservation via Snapbid Limited, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the accommodation provider. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the accommodation, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant accommodation provider and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the accommodation provider. The booking confirmation is from the accommodation provider via our site and is not generated by Snapbid Limited. Any booking or reservation reference numbers or codes are generated by the accommodation provider and are not a Snapbid point of reference. <br> </p>
<p>Snapbid Limited is not responsible at any time for the accuracy of the information, including the rates and availability displayed on our website. Our website does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating of any accommodation made available.</p>
<p>By making a reservation/booking, you accept and agree to the cancellation or no-show policy of the provider, and to any additional terms and conditions of the hotel or property provider that may apply to your reservation/booking during your stay. The general cancellation and no-show policy of each hotel or property provider is made available on our website on the accommodation information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Please note that a reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the accommodation and the reservation. Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the accommodation agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>
<p>If you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount. We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.</p>
<p>Taxes; the local authorities in certain countries may impose additional taxes (tourist tax, etc), which generally have to be paid locally. The Customer is exclusively responsible for paying such additional taxes. The amount of taxes can change between booking and stay dates. In the event that taxes have increased as at your stay date, you will be liable to pay taxes at the new higher rate.</p>
<h4>Pay on Line or pay later on arrival or exit; with hotels, the Customer may be presented with the payment option to "pay online now" or "pay at hotel later". If the Customer selects the "pay online now" option, the accommodation provider will charge the amount to their credit card in British pounds sterling immediately. If the Customer selects "pay later at hotel", the hotel will charge the Customer's credit card in the local currency of the relevant hotel at the time of the Customer's stay. In addition to any other taxes and fees payable by the Customer as set out in these General Terms and Conditions, taxes and fees may vary depending on which payment option the Customer chooses. Please note that some hotels may require a deposit which may or may not be refundable (please see Suppliers Rules and Restrictions). Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. Your credit card provider may also charge a foreign currency conversion fee.</h4>
