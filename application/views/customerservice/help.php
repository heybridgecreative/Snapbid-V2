<p>When bidding:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you have account, you can use the Login/Register section to log into your account. However, if you are new to the website, you can use this page to create an account and begin your Snapbid journey.</li>
<li>Select a destination</li>
<li>Enter your travel dates</li>
<li>Enter the number of people of your travel</li>
<li>Choose accommodation type i.e. hotel, apartment, house, villa.</li>
<li>Submit search</li>
<li>Tailor your requirements through the filtering system</li>
<li>Choose a property from the provided list</li>
<li>In the case of hotel select room type i.e. single, standard double, deluxe etc.</li>
<li>The page will open with your preferred choice with a posted price for your stay; the price quoted is the cheapest available on alternative sites. If the accommodation is willing to accept a bid on your dates of occupation, it will have a bid icon and a book icon. If the accommodation is not on the bidding system or does not wish to take a bid for your chosen dates, the bid icon will not appear and only the book it icon will be visible.</li>
<li>If the bid icon is visible, it means the accommodation provider is prepared to accept a bid for your stay.</li>
<li>By clicking on the bid icon you will be taken to a bidding platform where you can enter a price that you think your stay is worth or you are prepared to pay. The accommodation provider has placed a reserve on your chosen dates that he is prepared to accept from you. This reserve is not seen by you. Your quest is to find this price by making a bid. If the bid is not high enough the bidding platform will tell you that the bid has not been accepted and asks you to bid again. You can make as many bids as you want to try and find the reserve price. Once you have identified the reserve price the bidding system will tell you that you bid has been accepted. If you are happy to accept this price and want to book it, press the book it now icon and the reservation procedure with commence. You are not obliged to accept the bid at any stage up until you enter your payment details and confirm your booking.</li>
<li>After accepting the reservation, you will be required to pay a 10% deposit to Snapbid. You will then receive a confirmation of your stay from the accommodation provider with their confirmation of the accommodation with their own booking number and contact details. In most cases you will be asked to provide your credit/debit card details to the accommodation provider directly. The balance of your payment will be set out by the accommodation provider in their own terms of payment i.e. on arrival, on exit or in advance of arrival.</li>
<li>Each accommodation provider has their own cancellation policy which will be set out in the booking confirmation sent to you. Snapbid is not responsible for the hotels cancellation policy (see terms and conditions).</li>
<li>Any errors in the booking information should be rectified by the accommodation provider directly and not with snapbid. If you wish to upgrade your room or change the dates then you should also inform the accommodation provider directly. This may be subject to an increase in the cost of your stay however and this is at the discretion of the accommodation provider.</li>
<li>If the bid icon is not visible, the accommodation provider will only sell at the posted price and you are happy to pay this price, then the same will apply through the reservation system as the accepted bid price.</li>
