<ol class="faqs">
<li><strong>How do I know my booking is secure?</strong><br/>Your booking is confirmed by the accommodation provider directly to you. In the confirmation it will have all the contact info from the provider, including their reservation number. The reservation will include the term of you stay and the price. It will also tell you the type of room you have booked. If any of the information is incorrect, you can contact the accommodation provider directly and they will help you. If you wish to change you booking information that you originally booked through our system, it could be subject to price change and availability</li>
<li><strong>When do I pay?</strong><br/>When you accept the booking through the bidding platform or a book it now price you will be asked to pay a 10% deposit. The balance of your stay will vary due to the accommodation supplier&rsquo;s terms of payment. You may be asked to pay on arrival, on exit or in advance. Your booking confirmation will tell you when you receive it from the provider. In most cases you will have to guarantee payment to the provider by credit card or debit card.</li>
<li><strong>What happens if I want to cancel my booking?</strong><br/>In the event of you having to cancel your booking, it will depend on the accommodation provider&rsquo;s cancellation policy which will be set out in your booking confirmation. Each accommodation provider&rsquo;s cancellation policy can be different, so please check the policy and be fully aware of the conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Can I find out what the cancellation policy is before I book?</strong><br/>Yes you can access the accommodations provider&rsquo;s website directly and check their policy prior to booking.</li>
<li><strong>If I cancel my booking will I receive my 10% deposit back?</strong><br/>This will be subject to the accommodation provider&rsquo;s cancellation policy. If the cancellation is made in time that does not incur any penalties, then yes it will be returned to you in full. If however the cancellation does incur penalties the deposit will be subject to the same percentage fee.</li>
<li><strong>What does my price include?</strong><br />This information should be on your booking confirmation that you correctly entered in to the booking request information. If it is different, then please contact the accommodation provider directly. It should state in your booking confirmation all extras like breakfast, meals, airport transfers, taxes and duties that may be applicable and the total inclusive price for your stay.</li>
<li><strong>What happens if I do not arrive at the hotel or apartment through no fault of my own, like flight s being cancelled?</strong><br/>Again this will depend on the no show policy of the accommodation provider set out in their terms and conditions. It is always advisable to take out suitable travel insurance to cover this situation.</li>
<li><strong>Can I cancel my booking through Snapbid?</strong><br/>No, all cancellations should be carried out directly with the accommodation provider.</li>
<li><strong>If I have booked accommodation and do not receive a booking confirmation, what do I do?</strong><br/>First check all your junk and spam folders for the email address you have provided and look for the confirmation there. If you have still not received it then please send an email to us at info@snapbid as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Do I receive a receipt for my accommodation?</strong><br/>Yes, the accommodation provider will issue you a receipt upon payment at the location and Snapbid will send you a receipt for the 10% deposit paid in advance.</li>
